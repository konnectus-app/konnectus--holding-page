      <h2>2. License to the Application</h2>

      <p>
        If you elect to download the Application and accept these terms upon
        Sign Up, the following applies:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Provided that you continue to comply with the terms of this Agreement,
          Konnectus hereby grants you (i) a limited, non-exclusive and
          non-transferable right to install and use the Application, (ii) a
          limited, personal, non-exclusive and non-transferable right to use the
          Service through the Application in accordance with the Agreement.
          Konnectus is entitled to refuse, restrict, limit, suspend and/or
          interfere or interrupt the Application or any part thereof without any
          notice to you, in order to install a patch, revise, update, replace,
          repair, improve, and/or upgrade the Application, or for any other
          reason.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the purposes of this Agreement, “Application” includes any
          patches, revisions, updates, upgrades or replacements of the
          Application (the “Revisions”) that may be delivered to you or that you
          may receive. You also agree that upon the installation of any
          Revisions, you are only permitted to use the Application as modified
          by the Revisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall
          be construed as to obligate Konnectus to provide you with any
          Revisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any Application accessed through or downloaded from an “App Store”
          such as the Apple App Store or “Google Play” (an “App Store
          Application”), you will only use the App Store Application: (i) on a
          product that runs the operating system for which it was intended and
          (ii) as permitted by the “Usage Rules” set forth in the corresponding
          App Store. You agree that the terms of this Agreement are between you
          and us and not with the owner or operator of the App Store (“App Store
          Owner”). We, and not the App Store Owner, are solely responsible for
          the Services, including the Application, maintenance, support
          services, and warranty, and addressing any claims relating thereto
          (e.g., product liability, legal compliance or intellectual property
          infringement). You acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party
          claim that the App Store Application or your possession and use of
          that App Store Application infringes that third party’s intellectual
          property rights, as between Us and the App Store Owner, We, not the
          App Store Owner, will be solely responsible for the investigation,
          defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property
          infringement claim to the extent required by this Agreement. You and
          we acknowledge and agree that the App Store Owner, and the App Store
          Owner’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement
          as related to your license of the App Store Application, and that,
          upon your acceptance of this Agreement, the App Store Owner will have
          the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce
          the terms of this Agreement as related to your license of the App
          Store Sourced Application against you as a third-party beneficiary
          thereof.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Data Charges</h2>

      <p>
        You acknowledge that data charges may be incurred through your use of
        the Application and you agree that you are responsible for any and all
        such charges that may be charged to you and that Konnectus shall have no
        liability to you whatsoever in respect of such charges.
